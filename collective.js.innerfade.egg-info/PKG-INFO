Description: Overview
        ========
        
        collective.js.innerfade installs the `jQuery innerfade plugin <http://medienfreunde.com/lab/innerfade/>`_. On top of that, it adds an additional view to ATFolder which will activate the jQuery plugin for Image and Link instances that were added to it.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Software was created and tested on Plone 4.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        Stable; almost used in a production environment :)
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use buildout, or a similar method to install collective.collage.innerfade, (re)start your Plone instance and use the quick installer to install the product.
        
        #. Create a Folder.
        #. Add Image instances. For best results, add four Images in total and use an aspect ratio of 16:9 
        #. Select the Innerfade view of the Folder you just created.
        #. Now, if you want the Images to contain links, add Link instances to the Folder. When you use the exact same id of an Image in the Folder and suffix it with ``.link``, the Link will attach itself to that particular Image, e.g.::
        
            Folder
                Image image-1
                Link image-1.link
                Image image-2
                Link image-2.link
                Image image-3
                Link image-3.link
                Image image-4
                Link image-4.link
